This is a simple PHP proxy that can be dropped into your web servers 
document root and be ready to go.   There are only two requirements:

1) The script must have write permissions in document root.
2) The name of the script must remain 'proxy.php'.
(allowing the script to be placed anywhere and renamed is on my todo list)

Now run the script by using with the following parameters:

__target_host=<url of the target host with out path>
__target_path=<the path of the url>


for example:

http://localhost/proxy.php?__target_host=http://www.devoxx.com&__target_path=/display/Devoxx2K10/Home



This is the alpha version.  It works fairly well on basic sites, but
will fall down when it encounters dynamic content, as it does not
handle javascript generated urls.
